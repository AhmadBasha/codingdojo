-Shuffle the deck (Function 1)
-Deal 5  to the players depending on how many players there are.
-If you don't have enough cards for how many players then your function should output that there are not enough cards for everyone before dealing. (Function 2)
-Save the cards each player gets to a variable designated for that player.


-Repeat tasks 1-3 but create a function that can deal 5, 7, or 10 cards for each player. The number of cards dealt could be an argument for your function.
