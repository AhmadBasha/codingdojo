-Create a 2 player game and calculate the value of each hand using the "Value" column and create an if-else statement that says if player 1 or player 2 has more points. Your output should show if Player 1 or Player 2 has more points by saying "Player 1 has more points than Player 2. Player 1: <point value here>, Player 2: <point value here>"

-Create a 3 player game and do the same thing as Task 1 and determine who has the highest value hand.

-Determine if a hand has a "pair". A pair is when two cards have the same "face" column name.
-Determine if a hand has 3 of the same "face" column values in its hand.
-If there is a tie in the amount of value between players hands write a conditional statement to reflect there was a tie and between which players.
