Munging Project
Pick a data set that is not clean and go through the process from beginning to end until it is tidy, Then perform EDA on that data set and tell us what you learned. The following websites contain links to several not tidy data sets, but feel free to find something that you like to work with.

Minimum Requirements

Make at least 4 plots showing different insights.
You must clean and tidy your data. If your dataset does not require cleaning then you cannot use the dataset.
Write an explanation of what insights are seen in each plot.
You are not allowed to use any datasets used in the lecture.
Be prepared to present your cleaning process and plots on Sunday during group presentations at 10 AM.
