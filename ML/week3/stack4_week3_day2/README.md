# PCA With Diabetes Dataset

## Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is predict if someone is diabetic or not by using built models.

### Methods Used
* EDA
* Data Visualization
* Logistic Regression
* Pipeline
* Standard Scaler
* PCA
* GridSearchCV

### Technologies
* Pandas, jupyter
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sklearn

## Project Description

Using a Diabetes Database and creating three different models after seeing the baseline. The first model is LogisticRegression after performing the scaler. Then, 
creating a second one with pca. Compare all the results with the basline. Deleting some features after creating scree plot and perform the new model.

## Needs of this project

- data exploration
